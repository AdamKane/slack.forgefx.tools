# Update Plan.md

Work step by step through the following checklist. Show your work, thoughts, reasoning, and conclusions for each step.

Step 1: Review the current application plan (./PLAN.md)
Step 2: Review the current @codebase 
Step 3: Review the current pytest test results (./tests/test_results.txt)
Step 4: Compare the plan to the codebase and test results.
Step 5: Update the plan to accurately reflect the current state of the application
Step 6: Update the 'Next Steps' section of the plan with up to date information (focus on adding user-facing features list in the Application Description section, not scaffolding or other non-functional changes or optimizations)
Step 7: Update the 'Next Step' section based on the very next step, and decomposing that step into a checklist of smaller sub-steps.
Step 8: Modify the PLAN.md file with the updated plan.
